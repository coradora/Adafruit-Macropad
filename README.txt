Just some random macros that I've thrown together while tinkering with this. Will update this repo with more as I make them. 
Dependencies:
    * CircuitPython 7.0 alpha
    * adafruit_hid
    * adafruit_display_shapes
    * adafruit_display_text
    
Some features, such as volume control, you may need to set keyboard shortcuts to match the binds in the macro.
